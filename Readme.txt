Setup Instructions

1. Download and Install XAMPP/WAMP
   - Download XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or WAMP (http://www.wampserver.com/en/) depending on your operating system.
   - Install the software and start the Apache and MySQL servers.

2. Copy Project Files
   - Extract the contents of the zip file to the `htdocs` folder (for XAMPP) or `www` folder (for WAMP).
   - Ensure all PHP files, CSS, JavaScript, and image files are placed inside a folder named `hospital_management` in `htdocs`/`www`.

3. Database Setup
   - Open `phpMyAdmin` (usually accessible via `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
   - Create a new database called `myhmsdb`.
   - Import the SQL schema file (`myhmsdb.sql`):
     - Go to the "Import" tab.
     - Choose the file `myhmsdb.sql` from the `database` folder in your project.
     - Click "Go" to complete the import.

4. Update Database Connection
   - Ensure the database connection settings in the `config.php` file are correct:
     ```php
     <?php
     $con = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "myhmsdb");
     if (!$con) {
         die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
     }
     ?>
     ```
   - You can update the `localhost`, `root`, and password as needed if your environment has different settings.

5. Configuring Razorpay (for Payment Gateway)
   - Open the `payment.php` file and replace the following test API keys with your Razorpay test keys:
     ```php
     $apiKey = 'rzp_test_XZk7d1cPiuxuSM';  // Replace with your test API key
     ```

6. Accessing the Application
   - Visit `http://localhost/hospital_management` in your browser.
   - You should now be able to access the hospital management system.

7. Admin Login  
   - URL: `http://localhost/hospital_management/admin.php`
   - Default Credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`

8. Patient Login
   - URL: `http://localhost/hospital_management/login.php`
   - Users can register or login as patients.

9. Live Chat Setup
   - Ensure your chat feature is set up in `chat.php`, where patient-doctor communication happens based on the appointment. 

10. Bed and Room Management
    - You can manage the hospitalâ€™s bed and room allocations in the **Admin Panel**. To modify patient details, navigate to the `bed_management.php` file.
